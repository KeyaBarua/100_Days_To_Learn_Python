## Project - BlackJack Game

This is a capstone project built using all the tools learnt in Python till now. Blackjack project represents the online Blackjack card game (https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack). The rules are as follows:
1) The object of the game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer (computer) without going over 21.
2) If a hand goes over 21, the wager is lost. Jacks, Queens, Kings and 10s count as 10. An Ace may be played as a one or an 11. All other cards are played at face value.
3) When you receive your first two cards, you may either “stand” or “hit.” When you “stand” it means you feel you are close enough to 21 and no longer wish any additional cards. “Hit" means you wish to receive another card.
4) You may draw as many cards as you want until you are close to 21 or until you “bust.”
5) If you are closer to 21 than the dealer (computer), you win. If your hand is less than the dealer’s, you lose. If the dealer’s hand “busts”, you win as well. If both dealer and you have same points, it is a draw.
If your initial two cards total 21, any Ace with a 10, Jack, Queen, or King, you have a Blackjack.
