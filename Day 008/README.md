## Project - Caesar Cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
The project "Caesar Cipher" can take a message and encrypt or decrypt the message by shifting the alphabets by a number of positions.
